# Portfolio
This Repository contains various data science projects and some micro software engeneering projects completed by me for academic, selflearning and hobby purposes.

## Contents

### Machine Learning (Supervised/Unsupervised)

-__Python__
- [Predicting California Housing Prices](githublink): First, I conducted Data Wrangaling and a explanatory Data Anaylsis with visulization to determine the important  features. Created a random forrest regressor model to predict the value of a given house.

_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
   
- __R__
-coming up...

### Deep Learning

-__Python__
- [Object Detection: filename](githublink): A transfer learned modell to detect the Tchibo trademark and faces on pictures.

 _Tools: Tensorflow Object Detection API, Colab, etc.....
 
### Data Analysis and Visualisation
-__Python__
-[[Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](githublink): An Exploatory Data Analysis of the passenger of the Titanic using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn visualisations.
  
_Tools: Pandas, Pandas Profiling, Seaborn, MAtplotlib_
  
-__R__
- coming up...

### Micro Software Engineering projects
-__Java__: As one of my electives in my economics bachelor I chose "Software Engeneering 1". Here we leraned the fundamentals of Java as well as Object Oriented Programming. Accompanying to the lecture we had a excercise of 3 Hours every week to complete a quizz on the lectures content and little programming excercises, which had to be reviewed by the instructor. In the follwong are some examples. You can find more examples in the repo "..."
- [Recursion, Regex, Strings: "filename"](githublink): Some description
