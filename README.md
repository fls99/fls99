### Hi there 👋

<!--
**fls99/fls99** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Computer Vison project for Tchibo as part of the TechLabs program. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Java
- 💬 Ask me about anything :)
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn

#Portfolio
This Repository contains various data science projects and some micro software engeneering projects completed by me for academic, selflearning and hobby purposes.

##Contents

-### Machine Learning (Supervised/Unsupervised)
-__Python__
        -[Predicting California Housing Prices](githublink): First, I conducted Data Wrangaling and a explanatory Data Anaylsis with visulization to determine the important  features. Created a random forrest regressor model to predict the value of a given house.
   _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
   
- __R__
      -coming up...
-###Deep Learning
-__Python__
      - [Object Detection: filename](githublink): A transfer learned modell to detect the Tchibo trademark and faces on pictures.
  _Tools: Tensorflow Object Detection API, Colab, etc.....
-### Data Analysis and Visualisation
-__Python__
    -[[Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](githublink): An Exploatory Data Analysis of the passenger of the Titanic using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn visualisations.
  _Tools: Pandas, Pandasprofiling, Seaborn, MAtplotlib_
  
-__R__
     - coming up...
-###Micro Software Engineering projects
-__Java__
- As one of my electives in my economics bachelor I chose "Software Engeneering 1". Here we leraned the fundamentals of Java as well as Object Oriented Programming. Accompanying to the lecture we had a excercise of 3 Hours every week to complete a quizz on the lectures content and little programming excercises, which had to be reviewed b< the instructor. In the follwong are some examples. You can find more examples in the repo "..."
      -[Recursion, Regex, Strings: "filename"](githublink): Some description
